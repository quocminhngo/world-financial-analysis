# Project Background
The long lasting pandemic has taken a toll on our economy with a snow ball effect that causes record high inflation, and mass lay-offs. With the looming recession, 
the goal of the project is to determine how the United States is doing financially in comparison to other countries around the world. From then, figure out if there
are factors that correlate with how well a country is doing financially, and visualize the findings. All the necessary data will be collected from the World Bank 
Groupâ€™s API.

# Data Source

The World Bank Group is a global partnership that fights poverty through sustainable solution and they have provided their data openly through their API, 
which will be leveraged to do this analysis.

# Data Extraction Method

I will make call requests to the World Bank Group's API to obtain all the necessary data.
